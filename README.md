This project is the capstone for my experience in LaunchCode's CoderGirl cohort.

I investigated the features of consumers to build a model to predict the likelihood of ad click-through based on specific features.
I trained a Decision Tree Classifier and pruned the max size tree using minimal cost complexity.
I found that the two most significant feature importances came from Time Spent Online and Time Spent on Site. 

My next steps are to use NLP and KMeans clustering to find predictive importance of Ad Topic Lines to click-through events.
